# Project 16: Heart disease indicators

## Topic: 
Heart disease prevention

## Summary: 
This dataset contains the 2020 annual centres for disease control and prevention 
(CDC) survey data of 400k adults related to their health status. Heart disease 
is one of the leading causes of death in the world. Key risk factors for heart 
disease may include: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, etc. 
Computational developments, in turn, allow the application of machine learning 
methods to detect "patterns" from the data that can predict a patient's 
condition. The identification of participants with high risk of development of a 
heart disease allows better prevention.


## Data details:
